# AituConnectApp

**AituConnectApp** is a cross-platform .NET MAUI mobile application with a RESTful backend API. It is a modern client for the original [AituConnect Telegram Bot](https://github.com/Vertiigor/AituConnect), reimagined with a graphical user interface and extended functionality.

This project is designed to help university students at Astana IT University (AITU) connect, collaborate, and exchange knowledge more efficiently through topic-based post sharing and user interactions.
